# Text summarization Project
### Goal : 
We used "Abstractive Text Summarization" approach to identify the important sections, interpret the context and reproduce in a new way. This ensures that the core information is conveyed through the shortest text possible, the sentences in summary are generated, not just extracted from the original text.

### Question : 
Is the model able to summarize the text while retaining the most important information?
